# card-game
Hey everyone at andros*
I appreciate your time in reviewing my little game.
I tried to make some comments in the code to tell you what I was thinking about.

I stayed within the suggested 60 minute timeframe. Had I taken more time I'd:
- abstracted the **deal** and **winner**
- handled pairs in determining the winner
- written a couple of specs

Assumming that you have a ruby environment setup. You can run the game by simply cloning the project and running *ruby -r "./card_game.rb" -e "CardGame.play"* from a CLI

I have no doubt forgotten something. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks
Bo
